# Voter Simulation
Voter simulation console application from week 3. The Voter Sim project was meant to put our Object Oriented Programming skills to the test. My implementation of this project includes the use of multiple classes, inheritance, and RSpec test code to adhere to TDD (test-driven development) principles.

* Run the application by issuing `ruby voter_sim.rb`
* Test the application by issuing `rspec` from the application's root directory. Rspec results should show 9 examples, 0 failures.
